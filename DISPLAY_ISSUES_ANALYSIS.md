# Website Display Issues Analysis

## Summary
After analyzing all files in the project, I've identified several issues that prevent the website or parts of it from displaying correctly.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing Icon Files
The `manifest.json` references icon files that don't exist:
- `/Images/icons/icon-192x192.png` - **MISSING**
- `/Images/icons/icon-512x512.png` - **MISSING**
- `/Images/screenshot-mobile.png` - **MISSING**
- `/Images/screenshot-desktop.png` - **MISSING**

**Impact**: This will cause 404 errors when the Progressive Web App tries to load, potentially preventing PWA functionality.

### 2. Service Worker Cache Issues
The service worker (`sw.js`) tries to cache files that may not exist:
- `/index.html` - The actual index.html is in `/pages/index.html`
- `/script.js` - This file doesn't exist in the project

**Impact**: Service worker installation may fail, preventing offline functionality.

### 3. Missing JavaScript Files
Several JavaScript files are not included in the HTML pages:
- `perplexity-chat.js` is not loaded in any HTML file despite chat widget HTML being present
- `modal.js` exists but is not included in pages that might need it

**Impact**: Chat functionality won't work even though the UI is present.

### 4. CSS Display Issues

#### Hidden Elements
Multiple elements are set to `display: none`:
- `.nav-menu` (line 195) - Mobile navigation menu is hidden by default
- `.chat-window` (line 1597) - Chat window is hidden by default
- `.boat-identifier-section` (line 101) - Hidden with `!important`

#### Potential Layout Issues
- The hero section has multiple conflicting styles across different media queries
- Navigation menu has complex display logic that might fail on certain screen sizes

### 5. Path Inconsistencies
- Pages in `/pages/` directory use relative paths (`../Images/`, `../js/`, `../styles.css`)
- Manifest.json has `start_url: "/pages/index.html"` but icon paths don't account for this
- Service worker caches `/index.html` instead of `/pages/index.html`

### 6. Missing Backend Integration
- `perplexity_backend.py` exists but there's no evidence of it being used
- Chat functionality references an API but no backend server is running

### 7. CSS Background Image Path Issues
Found inconsistent path references in CSS files:
- `styles.css` line 390: Uses absolute path `/Images/Boats/zeilboot-4-5.jpg`
- `styles.css` line 3501: Uses absolute path `/Images/Boats/zeilboot-4-5.jpg`
- Other CSS files use relative paths `../Images/`
- Mobile optimization CSS references images that may not exist (e.g., `-mobile.jpg`, `-tablet.jpg`, `.webp` versions)

**Impact**: Background images may not load correctly depending on the page location and server configuration.

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Create missing icon files** or remove references from manifest.json
2. **Update service worker** to cache correct file paths:
   - Change `/index.html` to `/pages/index.html`
   - Remove `/script.js` from cache list
3. **Add perplexity-chat.js** to HTML pages that have chat widget
4. **Fix path inconsistencies** in manifest.json
5. **Ensure nav-menu visibility** on mobile devices

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Check browser console for 404 errors
3. Test offline functionality after service worker fixes
4. Verify chat widget functionality after adding missing script

## Files That Need Modification

1. `manifest.json` - Fix icon paths or remove missing references
2. `sw.js` - Update cached file paths
3. All HTML files in `/pages/` - Add missing script includes
4. `styles.css` - Review display:none rules that might hide important content

## Browser Console Errors Expected

Without these fixes, you'll likely see:
- 404 errors for missing icon files
- 404 errors for missing optimized images (.webp, -mobile.jpg, -tablet.jpg versions)
- Service worker registration failures
- JavaScript errors for undefined chat functionality
- Possible layout issues on mobile devices
- Failed background image loads due to incorrect paths

## Additional Notes

The website structure suggests it's a boat rental service website with:
- Multiple service pages (boat rental, vacation house, camping, marina)
- Multi-language support (Dutch, English, German)
- PWA capabilities (when working correctly)
- Chat widget integration (currently broken)

The main entry point is `/pages/index.html`, not `/index.html` at the root, which is causing several path-related issues throughout the application.
